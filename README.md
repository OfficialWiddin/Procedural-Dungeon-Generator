# Procedural Dungeon Generation Algorithm
Here I present a procedural dungeon generation algorithm with a visual representation of the outcome, which can then be used to generate random levels for a game.

The whole procedure can be seen as:  
- Generate rooms  
- Seperate rooms  
- Main rooms  
- Delaunay Triangulation  
- Minimum spanning tree  
- Generate Hallways  
- Delete remaining rooms
